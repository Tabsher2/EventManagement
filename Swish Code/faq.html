	<div class="faq" onclick="toggle('faq1')">
		Doesn't the second player normally have to successfully make the first player's shot before getting to make their own?
		<div id="faq1" class="faa">
		In the normal rules of H-O-R-S-E, yes. However, we believed it would be more fun for both
		players if they each got to take turns making shots. That way if one player is much better than the other, they can
		still have a good time getting to make their own creative shots.
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="faq" onclick="toggle('faq2')">
		Isn't H-O-R-S-E normally allowed to have more than two players?
		<div id="faq2" class="faa">
		Normally, yes. But in the interest of maximizing fun, we believed it would be more enjoyable
		if the game was only between two players. A common part of mobile games is waiting for the opponent to take their turn since
		we all live busy lives. If you were in a game with five players, you might have to wait a full week before it was finally your
		turn again. Limiting matches to only two players will increase how often you get to play and hopefully make it more fun for all.
