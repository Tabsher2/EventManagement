		How do I add a University to the Website?
		<div id="faq1" class="faa">
		If you are registered as a University on our website, you are able to register one University to the system. Once
		a University is registered it can start allowing students and RSOs to list it as their University. You can also edit
		any info about the University you added to the system.

	<div class="faq" onclick="toggle('faq2')">
		If I register as a University, can I still perform the roles of a student?
		<div id="faq2" class="faa">
		No, you cannot register as both a student and a University with only one account. If you would like to perform the roles of
		both you will need multiple .edu e-mail addresses.

		Who is the admin for an RSO?
		<div id="faq3" class="faa">
		Whichever user creates the RSO will be assigned as the admin for that RSO.

	<div class="faq" onclick="toggle('faq4')">
		How do I register a new RSO?
		<div id="faq4" class="faa">
		Any student can register a new RSO. However you will need at least 5 other students from the same University to list as well
		when creating a new RSO otherwise the system will reject the request, as we do not want clubs with less than 6 members.

	<div class="faq" onclick="toggle('faq5')">
		Who approves my request to join an RSO?
		<div id="faq5" class="faa">
		Once you submit a request to join an RSO, a notification will be sent to that admin containing your information.
		The next time they log on to the system they will see your request on their main page and they can either confirm
		or deny your membership request. Upon being a confirmed member you will be able to see the events that RSO has published.
